#### ☁️Bushfires - The name is inspired by the phenomenon of forest fires in nature. In the natural world, wildfires possess a relentless power to sweep through everything, capable of spreading quickly and touching every tree in the forest, leaving scorched earth behind. Applying this concept to a web information gathering tool means that from its inception, the tool is designed to efficiently and comprehensively collect information from the web, akin to a wildfire that leaves no corner untouched, covering every "tree" in the digital world.
